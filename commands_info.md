### [`amp`, `amplifier`]
This command is part of the [The Amplifier](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1179897) plugin.

It brings up a menu for selecting which building the engineer will use, and it can be either:
 * The tf2 traditional dispenser; or
 * The amplifier, which grants crits within a radious specified by the server to teammates and enemy spies. It cannot be upgraded.

  Selecting the amplifier as your building is not recommend, because crits can be
awarded for 30 seconds simply by taunting, thus making the dispenser far more useful.

  The server might output `Unknown command: amp` to the console, but it works anyway.
Also, the menu will only show if you're currently an engineer, thus, you might
need to wait your respawn if you just switched classes.

### [`amp_help`]
This command is part of [The Amplifier](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1179897) plugin.

  Displays a pt-br translated text about what `amp` does. It is hard to understand
and badly translated. If you need info about the `amp` command, read the [`amp`, `amplifier`] entry above.

The server might output `Unknown command: amp_help` to the console, but it works anyway.

### [`em`, `equip`, `equipmodels`, `tf_models`]
This command is part of the [Model Manager](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=164630) plugin.

It brings up the model selection menu (think of models as alternate skins).

  Only some people have one or more skins available for them currently, so it is
useless for most players.

Known players bearing at least one model:
 * The Doge Master (claims to have received one as an award for helping the server)
